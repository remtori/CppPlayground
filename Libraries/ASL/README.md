# ASL - A Standard Library

My attempt at implementing all STL library, including but not limited to:

- [x] Assertions
- [x] Types: shorthand types
- [x] StdLibExtras: max, min, move, forward, swap
- [x] Smart Pointer: OwnPtr, RefPtr and their Nonnull counterpart
- [x] Optional
- [x] Vector
- [x] HashFunctions
- [x] SinglyLinkedList
- [x] HashTable
- [x] HashMap
- [x] Function
- [x] StringImpl
- [x] String
- [x] StringView
- [ ] UniqueString (string with the same value has the same implementation)
- [ ] StringBuilder
- [ ] DoublyLinkedList
- [ ] WeakPtr
- [ ] ByteBuffer

The order above is also the priority of these things
