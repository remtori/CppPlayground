# ASL - A Standard Library

My attempt at implementing all STL library, including but not limited to:

- [ ] Assertions
- [ ] StdLibExtras: max, min, ... move, exchange, forward, swap
- [ ] Smart Pointer: OwnPtr, RefPtr and their Nonnull counterpart
- [ ] Optional
- [ ] ByteBuffer
- [ ] Function
- [ ] Vector
- [ ] SinglyLinkedList
- [ ] HashFunctions
- [ ] HashTable
- [ ] HashMap
- [ ] WeakPtr
- [ ] StringImpl
- [ ] String
- [ ] UniqueString (string with the same value has the same implementation)
- [ ] StringBuilder
- [ ] StringView
- [ ] Types: shorthand types
- [ ] DoublyLinkedList

The order above is also the priority of these things
